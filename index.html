                    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                    <p>I grew up in the Seattle area of Washington State and developed an early passion for computer programming, teaching myself Python at the age of 14. This interest has grown into a lifelong pursuit, shaping both my education and career aspirations.</p>

                    <p>I graduated <strong>magna cum laude</strong> from Western Washington University in June 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, achieving a 3.98 GPA and completing minors in German and Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in the CS pre-master’s program, taking graduate-level courses early. I am now pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer Science as part of WWU’s accelerated program and plan to graduate in Spring 2025.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I serve as a <strong>Graduate Teaching Assistant</strong>, mentoring students in core computer science topics, and as a <strong>Graduate Research Assistant</strong> for Professor Brian Hutchinson, applying deep learning techniques to astronomical datasets.</p>

                    <p>I’m seeking <strong>full-time software development roles</strong> for after graduation. While I’m open to a variety of opportunities, my interests lean toward <strong>systems and networking</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Outside of academics and work, I enjoy exploring challenging programming projects. You can find some of my hobby projects and more details about my professional journey on my personal website: <a href="https://dylan-carroll.com/programming" class="GenericLink">https://dylan-carroll.com/programming</a>.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Hire Me</h3>
                    <p>I am currently seeking full-time software development roles starting in 2025. My strong academic background, hands-on experience in research and teaching, and passion for coding make me a valuable addition to any team.</p>
